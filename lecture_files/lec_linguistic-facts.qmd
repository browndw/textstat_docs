# Linguistic Facts of Life {background-color="#40666e"}

## Some foundational principles

-   All spoken language changes over time.
-   All spoken languages are equal in terms of linguistic potential.
-   Grammaticality and communicative effectiveness are distinct and independent issues.
-   Written language and spoken language are historically, structurally and functionally fundamentally different creatures.
-   Variation is intrinsic to all spoken language at every level, and much of that variation serves an emblematic purpose.

# Prescriptive vs. Descriptive Grammar {background-color="#40666e"}

## What do we mean by "grammar"

### What is a preposition?

-   Prepositions have semantic properties, such as indicating relationships in space and time or assigning qualities.
-   They also have syntactic (or grammatical) properties; for example, they take noun phrases (like *the box*) as their objects.

## A descriptive exercise

-  Group each use of *like* (by letter) with the others that you think share the same function.
    -   One way to determine this is by a "substitution test." Replace *like* with another word or phrase that means roughly the same thing and doesn't require you to change around anything else. Can you do that same substitution with any of the other excerpts?
    -   There are exactly 6 functions.
    -   Some don't have any others that match their function.

## What do we mean by "grammar"

### Descriptive grammar

-  Rules of language that describe how people communicate.
-  We can describe how words function syntactically and morphologically.
-  We can also describe who uses particular features and for what purposes—social, rhetorical, or both.

## Question

What we just did with *like* is an example of a problem called [polesemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysemy) or [word-sense disambiguation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation). How would you solve this problem at scale if faced with the task of classifying the different functions of *like*?

-  Language varies by:

    -   Use (register, genre)
    -   Situation (style)
    -   Individual (idiolect, style)
    -   Time (diachronic change)
